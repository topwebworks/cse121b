My Five Coding Resources Recommendations
Brett Snyder
CSE 121B > W07: Reflection

All five sites in the list below are my favorites coding resources. MDN and W3Schools are long-standing resources with a reputation for being the source of truth. The Modern JavaScript Tutorial is a newer site that has gained popularity with its focus on modern JavaScript features. Codecademy and freeCodeCamp are great resources for students that want a project-based approach to learning, as well as support from a large community of users.

5 rules for deciding my 5 coding resources recommendations - anything less is a poor resource:

Current info - provide accurate, up-to-date information that follows best practices. 

User-friendly interface - easy to navigate UI/UX and provide interactive exercises and tutorials. 

Strong community and support - active communities where students can ask questions and share their work. 

Practical info - provide useable information that is relevant to real-world scenarios.

Quality instruction - offer clear instructions and provide feedback to help students improve their skills.

MDN Web Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
MDN Web Docs has the latest and accurate Javascript info. The content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner using modern UI/UX. A community of developers and other contributors keep the MDN Web Docs up-to-date. The entire site is a wiki, meaning anyone can add to or edit the growing collection of documentation and tutorials. MDN is my "official" coding resource recommendation versus StackOverflow - which can be hit or miss.

W3Schools - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp
W3schools presents thousands of code examples. By using their online editor, "Try it Yourself", I can edit examples and execute computer code experimentally, to see what works and what does not, before implementing it. The site is widely popular and has a large and active community. W3Schools is usually the first place I look.

The Modern JavaScript Tutorial - https://javascript.info/
The tutorial is well-organized and easy to navigate, and it offers interactive examples and exercises. The site has a modern design that I really like, and is up-to-date with the latest JavaScript specs. The site is popular among mid-level students and developers - so stays current and easy to find what I am looking for.

Codecademy - https://www.codecademy.com/
Codecademy is "THE" first place people think of for learning coding online. The coursework is challenging and comprehensive, providing students with a well-rounded education in coding. One of the biggest advantages Codecademy is that they offer complete free courses while you explore skill paths and build code foundations. I use Codecademy more than Udemy for that reason.

freeCodeCamp - https://www.freecodecamp.org/
freeCodeCamp is a well-known nonprofit organization that provides a variety of free coding tutorials & certificates, including JavaScript. It offers videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - from the basics to advanced. Compared to to CodeAcademy, it will not only teach you syntax but also will force you to acquire critical thinking and problem solving skills with their bonfire section. The platform is widely popular and has a large community of students and mentors who provide help and feedback. Of the five sites, I use freeCodeCamp the least, but is still a great resource.
